---

**Description:**
ETH-DIAMOND v1 is an initial implementation of an Ethereum-based blockchain focusing on the tokenization of digital assets, specifically diamonds. This version presents a basic set of functionalities to create, transfer, and verify ownership of tokens representing diamonds on the Ethereum blockchain.

---

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js installed on your machine
- Ethereum client, such as Geth or Parity, configured and synchronized with the Ethereum network
- Basic knowledge of Solidity for Ethereum smart contracts
- Internet connection to interact with the Ethereum network

---

**Usage Instructions:**

1. **Cloning the Repository:**
   Clone this repository to your local environment:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/eth-diamond-v1.git
   ```

2. **Installing Dependencies:**
   Navigate to the cloned project directory and install Node.js dependencies:

   ```
   cd eth-diamond-v1
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configuring the Ethereum Network:**
   - Ensure your Ethereum client is running and synced with the Ethereum network.
   - Configure environment variables in the `.env` file with your Ethereum network details (host, port, default account, etc.).

4. **Deploying the Smart Contract:**
   - Compile and deploy the `DiamondToken.sol` smart contract on your Ethereum network. You can use tools like Truffle or Remix for this purpose.
   - After deploying the contract, update the contract address in the `config.js` file.

5. **Running the Application:**
   Start the Node.js application:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

6. **Interacting with ETH-DIAMOND:**
   - Use the provided REST API endpoints to create new diamond tokens, transfer tokens between accounts, and verify token ownership.
   - Diamond tokens are represented as ERC-20 assets on the Ethereum blockchain.
