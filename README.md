## Description:
POSEIDOM v4 is a diamond tokenization platform based on the Iron Bear v3 blockchain. This application allows the creation, transfer, and verification of ownership of tokens that represent diamonds on the Iron Bear network. In addition to these functionalities, POSEIDOM v4 now integrates Trident and Rubyx, enhancing its capabilities.

## Key Features:
- Creation of diamond tokens on the Iron Bear blockchain.
- Transfer of tokens between accounts.
- Verification of token ownership.
- Integration of Trident: ML, DL, and blockchain functionalities.
- Incorporation of Rubyx for quantum computing and hybrid digital asset creation.

## Prerequisites:
- Node.js installed on your machine.
- Iron Bear client configured and synchronized with the Iron Bear network.
- Basic knowledge of Solidity for Iron Bear smart contracts.
- Internet connection to interact with the Iron Bear network.

## Usage Instructions:

1. **Cloning the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/POSEIDOM-v4.git
   ```

2. **Installing Dependencies:**
   ```sh
