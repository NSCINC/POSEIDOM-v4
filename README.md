## Description:
POSEIDOM v4 is a diamond tokenization platform based on the Iron Bear v3 blockchain. This application allows the creation, transfer, and verification of ownership of tokens that represent diamonds on the Iron Bear network. This initial version features a basic set of functionalities to kickstart digital asset tokenization.

## Key Features:
- Creation of diamond tokens on the Iron Bear blockchain.
- Transfer of tokens between accounts.
- Verification of token ownership.

## Prerequisites:
- Node.js installed on your machine.
- Iron Bear client configured and synchronized with the Iron Bear network.
- Basic knowledge of Solidity for Iron Bear smart contracts.
- Internet connection to interact with the Iron Bear network.

## Usage Instructions:

1. **Cloning the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/POSEIDOM-v4.git
   ```

2. **Installing Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   cd poseidom-v4
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configuring the Iron Bear Network:**
   - Ensure your Iron Bear client is running and synchronized.
   - Configure the environment variables in the `.env` file with your Iron Bear network details.

4. **Deploying the Smart Contract:**
   - Compile and deploy the `DiamondToken.sol` smart contract on your Iron Bear network.
   - After deployment, update the contract address in the `config.js` file.

5. **Running the Application:**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

6. **Interacting with POSEIDOM:**
   - Use the REST API endpoints to create, transfer, and verify diamond tokens.
   - Diamond tokens are represented as ERC-20 assets on the Iron Bear blockchain.
